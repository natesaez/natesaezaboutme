                Hey there! I'm 21 years old, half Argentine, and currently studying Information Systems at BYU. Originally from Nephi, Utah, I now live in Provo while attending school. Iâ€™m a huge sports fan and love playing soccer, basketball, and football. I recently returned from a two-year LDS mission in Mexico, where I grew personally and gained an appreciation for different cultures. Thanks for visiting my page!
